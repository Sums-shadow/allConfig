Step 1
 
First of all, you have to check your internet connection and its speed. If your speed is slow, then you have a chance to occur the same error again, so you have to need a high-speed internet connection. 
 
Step 2
 
Open VS Code, then go to the Terminal and click on the new terminal.
 
Step 3
 
Run the command “npm cache clean --force" which is used to clean the npm memory in your system.
 
npm cache clean --force
 
Step 4
 
Then run the command “ npm uninstall –g @angular/CLI” (this command is used to uninstall Angular CLI from your system).
 
npm uninstall –g @angular/CLI 
 
Step 5
 
Now you have to again install Angular CLI using the command “npm install –g @angular/cli@latest” (this command is used to install angular CLI in your system from the server)
 
npm install –g @angular/cli@latest
 
Step 6
 
After the complete installation of Angular CLI, you have to check the versions of the angular CLI and npm version using a few commands.
